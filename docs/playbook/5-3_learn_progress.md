## Progress Tracking

### How It Works

1. You start watching a lesson
2. Progress saves every 10 seconds
3. When you return, resume from that spot
4. Lesson marks complete at 90% watched

### Progress Bar

Each course shows a progress bar:

```
Course Progress: [████████░░░░] 67%
```

- Green fill = completed portion
- Empty = remaining content
- Percentage = lessons watched / total lessons
