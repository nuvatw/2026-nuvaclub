## TL;DR

**Space = mentorship matching.** Find someone to learn from (Nunu) or teach (Vava).

Think of it like a study buddy system, but way better.

## Why Space Exists

Learning alone is hard. Space connects you with:

- **Nunus** (mentors) - People ahead of you who can guide you
- **Vavas** (mentees) - People behind you who you can help
